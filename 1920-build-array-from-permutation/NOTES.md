Method-1 would be to make a new vector and just store nums[nums[i]] in it.

Method-2

The idea is to store two numbers (nums[i] and nums[nums[i]]) at the same location.

The important point to be noted is that all numbers in the array are less than size of the array.

Example - Lets say we have two numbers in the array a = 3 , b = 2 and the size of the array is n = 5

We can store both 3 and 2 in a as follows:-

a = a + b * n

To get initial value of a we do a%n
To get the value of b we do a/n

a = a + b * n = 3 + 2*5 = 13

a % n = 13 % 5 = 3

a / n = 13 / 5 = 2

So we will use this technique to store two numbers in one location.

Why is it important that all numbers must be less than size of the array ?

Its because when we do

    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        nums[i] = nums[i] + n*(nums[nums[i]]);
    }
There may be cases when we have lost the value of nums[i] as it has already been replaced by nums[nums[i]].
So in such cases we need to get the previous values of nums[i] or a
This is done by finding nums[nums[i]] % n

    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        nums[i] = nums[i] + n*(nums[nums[i]]%n);
    }
Once we have stored two numbers in each location we can simply divide each number by n to get the desired output.

class Solution {
public:
	vector<int> buildArray(vector<int>& nums) 
	{
		int n = nums.size();

		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			nums[i] = nums[i] + n*(nums[nums[i]]%n);
		}

		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			nums[i] = nums[i]/n;
		}
		return nums;
	}
};
